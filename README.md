# Student Management System Challenge

School Management System Challenge was developed using Angular, Bootstrap CSS, Asp.Net Core 3.1, and SQLite database. Talking about the project, it has all the essential features. This project contains only the admin side where an admin user can CRUD and manage students profile as well as setup user accounts for other admin users. The Admin plays the main role in the management of the system. In this project, all the main functions are performed from the Admin panel.

Upon successful login, the administrator has full control of the system the system allowing the admin to perform features of CRUD operations as well as manage the students database. The system allows the user to add a new student profile, view and edit an existing profile, easily search for a profile using either the student's identification number and name (first or last), and delete from the list unwanted records.

Further more, an existing user account can set up an account for a new user, edit and delete an account.

## About Project
The application is a full stack solution. It comes in two parts, the frst part is the [StudentManagementSystem](https://github.com/Campilax/StudentManagementSystemChallenge/tree/main/StudentManagementSystem) which is the frontend application. It was developed using angular and bootstrap while the second part is [StudentManagementSystemAPI](https://github.com/Campilax/StudentManagementSystemChallenge/tree/main/StudentManagementSystemAPI) which is the backend application developed using Asp.Net Core and SQLite database.

### Software Requirements
- #### **Angular 13.0.1**
  Angular framework used for creating the interactive components of this application. It's full-featured JavaScript framework design enhances the simplicity and efficiency of this application and also in creating the dynamic, single page feature of this application, More so, it's supporting MVC (Model View Controller) programming structure is a key component of this application. Version 13.0.1 was used because of it's improved development time and speed <br />
  
- #### **Bootstrap 4.6**
  Bootstrap is a flexible and powerful front-end framework that provides a free collection of tools for creating websites and web applications. With HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components Bootstrap makes front-end web development faster and easier for responsive, mobile first projects. It is free and open source; hosted, developed, and maintained on GitHub. <br />
  
- #### **Asp.Net Core 3.1<=5.00**
  ASP.NET Core is a free, open-source web framework developed by Microsoft. It provides features that enable building the backend for this applications, as well as web APIs. The programming language that is used for the development of ASP.NET Core is C# programming language.

  ASP.NET Core is a redesign of the popular ASP.NET Model View Controller (MVC) and ASP.NET Web API frameworks. The result is a leaner and more modular framework that can run on the full .NET Framework on Windows and .NET Core on other platforms.

  Both parts of the framework, MVC and Web API, helped in creating the backend part of this applications.

  ASP.NET Core is a popular choice but is definitely not alone in the world of backend development. It is similar to other frameworks such as Laravel (PHP), Spring (Java), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Django (Python), and others. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. I chose ASP.NET Core for this project as it is one of the top frameworks out there, runs on the powerful C# language, and has wonderful IDE support. <br />
